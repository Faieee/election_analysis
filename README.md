## Overview of Election Audit
The PyPoll_Challenge.py script takes raw election data located in [resources/election_results.csv](resources) and outputs formatted results on per-candidate vote counts, per-county vote counts, election winner, and county with highest response rate to both the console and text file at [challengeAnalysis/election_analysis.txt](challengeAnalysis).
